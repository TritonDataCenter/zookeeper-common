# Shared Zookeeper config repo

- Repository: <git@git.joyent.com:zk-base.git>
- Who: Matt
- Tickets/bugs: <https://devhub.joyent.com/jira/browse/HEAD>

This repo is intended as a common submodule of the sdc-zookeeper and binder
zones, to reduce drift in the ZK config between the two.

For all other docs, see those repos.
